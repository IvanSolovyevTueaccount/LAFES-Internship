# LAFES

This repository contains a Simulink-based control and simulation architecture together with supporting MATLAB code for operating the **Lead and Follow Education Setup**.

The purpose of this repo is to:
- Provide a modular Simulink architecture for running and analyzing the system
- Interface with the real hardware setup
- Implement a linear state-space model of the system
- Enable direct comparison between the linear model and the physical system

This framework is intended for educational and research use within the LAFES context.

The Linux installation and toolkit (`Dependencies/`) used to run this setup were taken and modified from the RoboCup DevPC installation, provided by Tech United Eindhoven.

## Repo Structure

| File or Folder  | Purpose |
|-|-|
| `LAFES.slx` | Main Simulink model. Integrates all components of the repository to operate, simulate, and communicate with the LAFES hardware setup. Handles signal routing and hardware interfacing |
| `model.m`| Generates the linear state-space / transfer function model of the LAFES system. This model is used within `LAFES.slx` to simulate the theoretical system response. |
| `Arduino/` | Arduino files to run the accelerometer of the system|
| `Leafsprings/` | Siemens NX (`.prt`) design files containing the CAD models of the leaf-spring components used in the mechanical system.|
| `Dependencies/` | C source files compiled within `LAFES.slx`. These handle low-level communication between Simulink and the system hardware.|
| `Support/` | Supporting MATLAB scripts for post-processing and analysis, such as Frequency Response Function (FRF) generation and leaf-spring stiffness calculations.|
| `Old/` | Archived files from previous development stages. Retained for traceability and reference.|

## Simulink Architecture
`image of simulink`

The LAFES control framework is implemented entirely in Simulink and runs in External Mode on an Ubuntu-based PC. Communication with the hardware is performed over EtherCAT using custom S-Functions derived from the Tech United RoboCup toolkit.

### Operating Principle
The architecture runs two parallel system paths:

1. Real System Path
    - Controller → Hardware Interface → Physical Plant → Sensors

2. Simulated System Path
    - Simulation Controller → Linear Transfer Function Model

Both paths receive identical reference inputs, allowing direct comparison between the real system and model responses.

### Layout
The Simulink model (`LAFES.slx`) is structured into clearly separated subsystems:

|Subsystem|Responsibilities|
|-|-|
|**Reference Generation**| <ul> <li>Generates reference position signals (step, sine, chirp, etc.)<li>Allows switching between generated reference and measured leader position <li>Outputs reference to controllers and logging blocks </ul>|
|**Controller**| <ul> <li>Implements feedforward and feedback control strategies <li>Computes target torque based on reference and measured position <li>Outputs torque command to hardware and simulated plant <li>Logs controller outputs</ul>|
|**Hardware Plant Interface**| <ul> <li>Communicates with hardware via EtherCAT <li>Sends control commands to EPOS4 motor driver <li>Reads sensor data (motor encoder, linear encoders) <li>Reads homing microswitches <li>Performs unit conversions and scaling <li>Implements zeroing logic and safety checks </ul>|
|**Simulated Plant**| <ul> <li>Implements linear transfer-function model generated by `model.m` <li>Receives identical inputs as hardware system <li>Simulates theoretical system response <li>Enables direct comparison with real system </ul>|
|**State Machine**| <ul> <li>Manages software operating states (Homing, Operational, Stopped, etc.) <li>Monitors safety signals and emergency conditions <li>Handles system enable/disable logic </ul>|
|**Dashboard (User Interface)** | <ul> <li>Provides manual control inputs (enable, zeroing, selectors) <li>Displays current system state <li>Allows switching between input modes and disturbance settings <li>Controls operating configuration during runtime </ul>|
|**Data Logging**| <ul> <li>Displays key signals via scopes (real vs simulated) <li>Saves runtime data to `.mat` files using `ToFile` blocks <li>Enables post-processing such as FRF analysis </ul>|

# User Guide
The User Guide provides step-by-step instructions for operating the LAFES setup. It covers powering the system, launching the Simulink model, configuring the dashboard, running experiments, and handling data logging and safety features.

## Dashboard
The Dashboard provides the main user interface for operating the LAFES setup. It allows you to:
- **Zero positions** – Set the current position of the leader or follower mass as the zero reference before starting experiments.
- **Enable/Disable the system** – Controls whether the hardware path is active.
- **Select reference input** – Choose between generated reference signals or the measured leader position.
- **Select collocation** – Choose which mass position is used by the controller and for monitoring.
- **Apply disturbances** – Enable or disable disturbances (white noise) for testing or FRF measurements.
 
## Starting the setup
1. Turn on the PC.
2. Once the PC is fully booted, turn on power to the LAFES hardware.
### Launching the software
1. Open a terminal on the Ubuntu desktop (`Ctrl+Alt+T`).
2. Run the launching script with super-user privileges:
```
sudo ./launch_LAFES.sh
```
3. Wait for MatLab to open. The MatLab path will automatically be set to the correct folder
4. Wait for `LAFES.slx` to open in Simulink **automatically**.

## Running the setup
1. To start the setup, click the **Monitor and Tune** button in the **Hardware** section in the Simulink ribbon at the top of the screen.
2. The system will start running:
    - Real system path if enabled
    - Simulated path in parallel
    - Data logging begins automatically.
3. Check the dashboard to ensure zeroing and safety signals are correct before proceeding with experiments.
